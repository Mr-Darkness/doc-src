# Doc-sources

This repository contains sources used to generate images and documentation
for various parts of our documentation. Some of the documentation includes
 - [Wiki](http://wiki.bitcraze.io/ "Bitcraze Wiki")
 - [GitHub](http://bitcraze.github.com/bitcraze "Bitcraze GitHub")

The goal of this repository is to make sure that sources don't get lost and that
people who want to contribute can work with the source instead of the generated
copy. Typically this includes things like SVG images, where the generated PNG is added to
the wiki, and the SVG is just used as a source. If someone wants to edit
the image they need access to the SVG, not only the PNG.
